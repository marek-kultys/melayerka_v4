<h2>Interactions</h2>

<h3>"read more..." buttons</h3>

<p>"Read more" buttons are visible only on portrait positioned mobiles 
(they have <em>display</em> property set to <em>none</em> by default, see 
<code>button.read-more</code> in CSS).</p>

<p>To make a "read more" button, create button element of class <em>read-more</em>:
<code>&lt;button class="like-link read-more"&gt;read more...&lt;/button&gt;</code></p>

<p>Now content that should be showed after clicking the button must be placed 
immediately after it, with class set to <em>more</em>:
<code>&lt;p class="more"&gt;some content&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>

<p>Any tag can be used with class <em>more</em>, but <em>p</em> seems to be semantically the best.</p>

<p>After click, the button is hidden and the element of class <em>more</em> is showed. This 
is all done by CSS on modern browsers. On old webkits JavaScript will set timeout 
with a callback that adds class <em>more-visible</em> to the element.</p>

<h3>light off/on effect</h3>

<p>To enable switching light on/off, add button of class <em>toggle-light</em> anywhere:
<code>&lt;button class="toggle-light"&gt;press to see in dark&lt;/button&gt;</code></p>

<p>The image that should be replaced with a <em>glowing</em> version needs to be of class <em>glow</em>.
After light goes off, JavaScript will find image of the same name, just with added <em>-dark</em>
before file extension, and load it. So, <em>/any/path/image.jpg</em> will be replaced with <em>/any/path/image-dark.jpg</em>.</p>

<p>Clicking the button will also toggle class 'dark' on <em>body</em> element, so CSS can do the job. To change styles,
use <em>body.dark ...</em> selector.</p>

<h2>Retina</h2>

<p>Retina versions of images are loaded by retina.js library. It finds images of the same name, just with added <em>@2x</em>
before file extension. So, if the original image is <em>/any/path/image.jpg</em>, retina.js will load <em>/any/path/image@2x.jpg</em>
(if it exists).</p>

<h2>Preloading</h2>

<p><em>Glow</em> versions of images, mobile dividers (for both light on and light off versions) are preloaded.</p>

<h2>js/bundle.min.js</h2>

<p>This file consist of concatenated and minified libraries:
* jquery
* prefixfree - to automate CSS prefixing
* html5shiv-printshiv - to make HTML5 elements render and print in older IE.</p>
